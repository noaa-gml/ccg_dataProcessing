                       A=0 ==> FIT IS NOT A RESTART.
                       B=0 ==> DELTAS ARE INITIALIZED TO ZERO.
                       C=0 ==> COVARIANCE MATRIX WILL BE COMPUTED USING
                               DERIVATIVES RE-EVALUATED AT THE SOLUTION.
                       D=2 ==> DERIVATIVES ARE SUPPLIED BY USER.
                               DERIVATIVES WERE CHECKED.
                               RESULTS APPEAR CORRECT.
                       E=0 ==> METHOD IS EXPLICIT ODR.
