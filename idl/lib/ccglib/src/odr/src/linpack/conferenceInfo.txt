CALL FOR PAPERS

Dynamical systems have had an impact in many areas including
physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. This conference
will emphasize the interaction among disciplines that is a key
feature of the advances in dynamical systems and its
applications. It will bring together a diverse group of
mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from industry,
government, and academe.

                     --  How to Contribute  --
You are invited to contribute a presentation in either of the
following formats:

Contributed Presentations in Lecture or Poster Format

A lecture consists of a 15-minute oral presentation with an
additional five minutes for discussion. A poster presentation
consists of the use of visual aids, such as 8-1/2" x 11" sheets,
mounted on a 4' x 6' poster board. A poster session is two hours
long. Each contributor must submit a title and a brief abstract
not exceeding seventy five words. SIAM encourages electronic
submission of abstracts. To help in formatting your submission,
plain TeX or LaTeX macros are available by contacting SIAM at
meetings@siam.org. 

The organizing committee reserves the right to limit the number
of contributed presentations a single speaker may present.

Deadline for submission of contributed abstracts: November 7,
1994.

Minisymposia

A minisymposium consists of four 25-minute presentations with an
additional five minutes for discussion. Prospective minisymposium
organizers are asked to submit a proposal consisting of a title,
a description (not exceeding one-hundred words), and a list of
speakers and titles of their presentations. Each minisymposium
speaker must submit a 75-word abstract. To obtain a minisymposium
proposal form, instructions and abstract forms, send your request
to meetings@siam.org.

Deadline for submission of minisymposium proposals: October 7,
1994.
