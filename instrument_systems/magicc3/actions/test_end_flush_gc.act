## action file to flush GC sample loops.  
#Uses the Picarro to pull sample through the loops
# 
#  FOR TESTING - ENDS FLOW
#  
#
#	$1 manifold
#	$2 port_num
# 	$3 GC qc data file
#
# 	QC data:
# 		sample_flow is the sample flow through the sample loops
# 		sample_press is the sample pressure during flow through the sample loops NOT
# 		the static pressure when injected
#
#	Turn manifold select because R0 not already on correct manifold. Duplicate call for other
#	sample types but that's fine.
