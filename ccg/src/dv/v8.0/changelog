v8.0 March 10, 2025
===================
Main change was to make pydv run natively on MacOS.  This required
- assumed drives were mounted under /Volumes, so paths needed to be modified
- the ComboListBox didn't work, so had to revert to standard ComboBox

In order to quickly access target data from the insitu_data database table,
added an index to the table for site_num, parameter_num, target

Added flagged target data to target plots.

Lots of general syntax clean up to satisfy the spyder ide syntax

v7.1 June 9, 2022
=====================
changes to fl module to plot flagged flask data as a separate dataset, and
to not include them in the determination of the y axis scale.  They will be
plotted on the axis line if off scale instead. Also synced axis for graphs in
fl module.

Fixed graph5 so that syncAxis takes an id number, and only graphs with that id
number will sync.  This will prevent a syncAxis in the fledit module to not
affect graphs in the caledit module for example.

v7.0 Winter 2022
=====================
converted to python 3
Major changes in a lot of different areas.


v6.0 May 2019
===============================
Major rewrite of a lot of things.  Cleaned up code to be more consistent with
spaces vs tabs for indentation.  Put import for each of the  modules into
the callback when module icon button is clicked, instead of at top.  This
means code is imported when called, not at startup.
Improved structure of nledit, fledit, caledit
programs.  Updated isedit to handle mlo picarro system.  Updated fledit, to i
handle magicc-3.  Updated fledit, nledit, caledit to include qc files
available on magicc-3 and co2cal-2. Many more changes

v5.3.5 July 28, 2016
===============================
Changed the 'get' dialog to allow selecting different flask methods, and an
option to plot different methods in different symbols.

v5.3.4 July 6, 2016
===============================
Changes to flask flagging module:

- Call fledit to plot raw file data instead of using RawFilePlot.py
- Revisions to get.py to fix problems with binning when during flask
flagging.
- Changed fledit.py to accept raw file name on startup to use.

Changes to ccgvu:

- Added option to include column names in export of ccgvu data to file.
- When exporting data to grapher, convert decimal date values to datetime
values.
- when using Get dialog, if both checkboxes for soft flags and different
symbols are checked, then plot flagged data on Data tab graph.  The flagged
data is not used in the curve fit.

v5.3.2 August 13, 2015
===============================
Revamped the 'get' dialog in common to allow getting flagged data as separate
datasets.

Removed usage of the common/data.py module for creating graph datasets,
instead use the built in graph createDataset routine.


v5.3.1 July 01, 2015
===============================
Cleaned up code to remove usage of db() class from /ccg/src/python/db.py
Replaced with dbutils module

v5.3.0
===============================
Removed the 'Flask Raw Files' module. This is better handled by the program
/ccg/src/fledit/.

Replaced the Get Data dialog in grapher and ccgvu.  Instead of a wizard based
dialog, used a more common form type dialog.  This new dialog remembers your
current settings, so don't have to go through all the steps that were required
with the wizard dialog.

Replaced the grapher Target cals dialog with new dialog.

Removed grapher 'GC/NDIR raw data' and 'Insitu QC data' options from the
grapher 'Add Data' menu.  These are handled better by the isedit
program. 

Added another format type to import data, 'Y1', which will read a single
column of values, using the line number as the x value.

v.5.2.4 12 Aug 2013
===============================
Modified the automated flask selection to include date, time, id, and method
in the results table. Also added a summary to the table, listing final flag
changes.  Fixed data input to take into account different strategies available.  
Added station code and parameter to the plot title.

v.5.2.3 14 Dec 2012
===============================
Modified cal.py to allow editing records if the database table is not
'calibrations'.

v.5.2.2 27 Nov 2012
===============================
Modified the common/regres.py file to include t test and probability
values for a linear regression.  A linear regression now uses the llinregress
routine from astats.py instead of numpy.polyfit.  The llinregress returns
the t and probability values that can be used for determining if the
slope coefficient is significant.

Removed the 'Export to Grapher' option in ccgvu export.  This didn't work
so only option is to export to file.

v.5.2.1 06 Nov 2012
===============================
Changed the 'Get Data' dialog in the flask editing module fl to
include the flask strategy, either normal flasks or pfp flasks.  Some sites
do both, so this gives the user an option of choosing only one of them.

The above changes required an update of some routines in the utils.py file 
to handle strategies.

v.5.2.0 24 Oct 2012
===============================
Revised the getFlDialog for fl and flsel to use a custom choice widget
picking the site, a listbox instead of listctrl for the parameter, and 
used static text boxes to group the widgets.

Updated flraw to plot each reference tank as a different dataset instead
of having all references as one dataset.

Added plot of filter response in ccgvu. 

Added a couple of utility routines in common/utils.py:
	getSiteList for getting list of site codes and names for a project,
	getMinMaxDates for getting min year and max year for flask data at a site

change calibration dialog to not allow editing a database record except for the flag
and notes, rather than any field in the record.

Created just one SiteStrings dialog, used by fl and flraw.

v.5.1.3 22 Oct 2012
===============================
Modified fl (manual flask flagging) to include the ability to view
back trajectory for the selected data point.

v.5.1.2 16 Mar 2012
===============================
Changed SiteStrings.py in fl module to use flpro.py for all
species.  flpro.py was updated to handle all gases.

v.5.1.1 24 Feb 2012
===============================
Changed SiteStrings.py in fl module to use flpro.pl to get
site strings for ch4 and co.  flpro.py previously used works only
for co2.

Fixed typo in fl.py.  Was data.setData(), should have been
data.SetData().

Added an about() box with version number.
