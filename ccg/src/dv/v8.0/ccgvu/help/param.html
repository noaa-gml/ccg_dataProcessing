<h1>Parameters  [Edit Menu]</h1>
The Parameters Dialog is for changing parameters of the function fit
and filtering of the data.
<p>
The following are the options of the Parameter dialog box:

	<b>Function Parameters</b> 
<p>
<center><img src="param.gif"></center>
		<dd>
		Modify the parameters of the initial function fit (
		<a href="overview.html#function">Equation 1</a>).
		These parameters are:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Number of polynomial terms.
			Default = 3, except when number of years of 
			data <=2 then the number of polynomial terms = 2. 
			Maximum of 9 is allowed.
			** IMPORTANT ** Whenever new data is read into the
			program using either the open or import options,
			the number of polynomial terms is reset to 3.

		<li>
		Number of harmonic terms.
			Default = 4.  Maximum of 10 is allowed.
		</ul>

	<b>Filter Parameters</b>
<p>
<center><img src="param2.gif"></center>
<p>
		<dd>
		Modify the parameters for the digital filtering of the residuals from the 
		function fit.  These parameters are:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Sampling interval.
		Default = 1 for daily averages, 7 for flask data,
		30 for monthly average data.  This value should be
		as close as possible to the actual sampling interval.
		DO NOT use a value smaller than the actual interval,
		or the filter results will be in error due to aliasing.

		<li>
		Short term cutoff.
		This is the cutoff value for the filter that smooths 
		the data.  Default = 50 days for daily averages, 
		80 days for flask data and monthly averages.  Note 
		that this has little affect on monthly averages since
		this data is already very smooth.

		<li>
		Long term cutoff.
		This is the cutoff value for the filter that removes 
		any yearly cycles and follows year to year variations.
		Default = 667 days.

		</ul>

<dt>
	<b>Zero Date for Coefficients</b>
<p>
<center><img src="param3.gif"></center>
<p>
		<dd>
		Modify the the date at which time = 0 for the coefficients of the 
		function fit.  The default date is -1, which uses the first year from
		the data.
		Only the year can be specified, and January 1 is used as the day.
