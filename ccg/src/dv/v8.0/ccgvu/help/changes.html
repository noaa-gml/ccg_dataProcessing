<title>CCGVU Changes</title>

<h2>
Changes to CCGVU Version 5.3.1<br>
June 25, 2003
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	Fixed export option for including the hour in the
	exported data in calendar format.  This never was
	implemented.  Also required changing ccgcrv a bit
	to accept a new -hr option.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Changes to CCGVU Version 5.3.0<br>
January 31, 2003
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	Data is now obtained from the CCGG MySQL database, 
	instead of the standard text files.
</li>
<li>
	Modified the Open dialog.  There are no longer multiple
	pages depending on the data type.  A single combo box
	is used for selecting the data type.
</li>
<li>
	Added character validation on
	entry boxes requiring only a float or integer number.
</ul>

<h2>
Changes to CCGVU Version 5.2.1<br>
September 13, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	Modified the Import dialog.  Included options for 
	specifying the number of lines to skip at the
	beginning of the file, and optionally specify values
	to ignore while reading the file.
</li>
<li>
	Fixed bug where statistics dialog could be destroyed
	by user having window manager destroy window, instead
	of using the 'Close' menu button.  This caused an error
	when opening new data files and trying to update the
	statistics window, which no longer existed.
</li>

<li>
	Fixed In-situ open dialog so that it will properly handle 
	an entry of the station code instead of a station name.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Changes to CCGVU Version 5.2.0<br>
August 2, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	Added another tab on the stats window to show 
	monthly means computed from the smooth curve
	in a date value column format.  This is in addition
	to the table format already present.

<li>
	Revised program for reading in-situ hourly data to
	handle new ch4 format that includes flags.

<li>
	Added a warning popup dialog in case user tries to
	export but hasn't choosen any data sets.  Prevents
	user from getting an empty export file.

</ul>

<h2>
Changes from version 5.1.0 to 5.1.1<br>
May 21, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	Modified the grid dialog for changing the parameters
	of the grid lines.  Added options for turning off
	the grid lines for either the x or y axis.

<li>
	Modified the graph options dialog to add a button
	allowing the user to change the background color
	of the graph.

<li> 
	Modified ccgcrv program to print out an error and stop
	if there are too many equally-spaced data points to
	filter.

<li>
	Added a catch for the ccgcrv program if it does not exit
	cleanly.  A dialog will pop up and give the output of
	the ccgcrv program.

<li>
	Modified Grid toolbar so axis mapping combo boxes now work.

<li>
	Modified dialogs so program doesn't attempt to create duplicates.
	If dialog already exists, it is raised to top of window stack.

<h2>
Changes from version 5.0.2 to 5.1.0<br>
May 8, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	Revised the Open dialog,  adding a notebook for the
	different data type options, adding options for binned
	shipboard data and binned aircraft data.  Also split
	up the in-situ and flask options to different pages.
	Revised flask and in-situ pages to allow entering a
	different file name instead of using the standard site
	directory.  This replaces using the 'Import' dialog for
	this choice.

<li>
	Made some minor fixes to the graph title, so the title
	will remain after changing filter parameters.

<li>
	Fixed bug in ccgvuread helper program to read 
	in-situ data from a user specified file.

<h2>

April 24, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Changed the method for getting a list of station codes 
for flask data in the Open dialog.  Program now looks at
all the codes listed in the directory '/projects/network/flask/site'
instead of using a static list of site codes.

<li>
Made some minor modifications to the import dialog.

<li>
Added a title to the graphs, based on either the station code
for data obtained from the 'Open' dialog, or the file name for
data obtained from the 'Import' dialog.

</ul>


<h2>
Changes from version 5.0.0 to 5.0.1<br>
April 23, 2002
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug in ccgcrv program for calculating monthly means
from smoothed curve.
</ul>


<h2>
Changes from version 4.40 to 5.0.0<br>
April 2002
</h2>

ccgvu has undergone a complete change from a C/Motif based 
application to a tcl/tk front end with C backend programs.
The front end graphical interface uses the blt graph widget
for displaying the data, and the BWidget toolkit for tcl/tk.
This has resulted in a simpler interface, additional features,
and faster development.
