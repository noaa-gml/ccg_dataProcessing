<h2>Function Fit to the Data</h2>
<hr>
<p>

   The first step is to fit a function which approximates the annual 
oscillation and the long term growth in the data.  The long term growth is
represented by a polynomial function and the annual oscillation is represented
by harmonics of a yearly cycle. This function can be fit to the 
data using methods of general linear least squares regression (that is, linear 
in its parameters) and can be solved by a variety of routines.  The routine 
used in this program is LFIT <i>(Press et al., 1986)</i>.  This routine also returns 
the covariances of the parameters so that an estimate of the uncertainty of the 
fit can be made.

<p>where k is the number of polynomial terms, and nh is the number of harmonics in
the function. Typical values used in CCG are 3 polynomial terms (a quadratic) and 
4 yearly harmonics.

<h2>Filtering of residuals</h2>
<hr>

<p>
 The next step is to calculate and filter the residuals of the original data
about the function.  These residuals are filtered in order to define
interannual and short term variations that are not determined by the function.

<p>
The filtering method is a slight modification of the filter explained by 
<i>Thoning et al (1989)</i>.  The major requirement for the FFT algorithm requires 
that the data be equally spaced without gaps.  Since the data never satisfies 
these requirements completely, some form of interpolation is needed.  The 
method used is simple linear interpolation between points. The interval between
data points is specified by the user, and is called the "sampling interval".

<p>
Another requirement 
of the FFT is that the number of points be equal to integral power of 2.  
This is achived by "zero padding" the data equally at both ends of the record 
until the correct number of points are obtained.  Because this zero padding can
affect the ends of the filter, the residuals are corrected so that the ends of 
the record are approximately zero.  This is done by taking approximately 1/2 
year of data at each end of the record (actually the long term cutoff value/4), 
performing a linear regression on this data, and correcting the residuals by the
slope of this line.  The data is then transformed to the frequency domain using 
standard FFT algorithms (e.g. REALFT, <i>Press et al., 1986</i>).



<p>
   The transformed data is multiplied by a low pass filter function (equation 2) where the 
cutoff frequency f<sub>c</sub> is chosen so that h(f) = 0.5 at f=fc.  The value of fc is
the only variable involved for determining the "stiffness" or frequency
response of the filter.  The residuals are filtered twice, once with a short
term cutoff values for smoothing the data, and once with a long term value to
remove any remaining seasonal oscillation and to track interannual variations
in the data not seen by the polynomial part of equation 1.  

<p>

<p>
The value for fc is specified in 'number of days', with typical values of 50 for
the short term filter, and 650 for the long term filter.  This value is changed in the
<a href="menus.html">"Edit - Parameters" dialog.</a>  Plots of the filter function
are shown on the <a href = "mainwindow.html">"Filter Response" tab of the main window.</a>

<p>
The filtered data
is then transformed back to the time domain with an inverse FFT.  The correction
due to the linear regression to the ends of the data is added back in to get
the final filter results.

<p>
The variance of the result of the filter is then calculated using equation 3.

where the terms are; the variance of the residuals about the filter, the sum of the
squares of the filter weights, and the covariance between data points, which takes
into account serial correlation in the data.

<h2>Determination of parameters</h2>
<hr>

<p>
   At this point, all curve fitting has been completed.  It is now just a
matter of combining the appropriate components of the function and the filter
to derive the signal parameter of interest.  The parameters of most
interest and how they are defined by CCG are:



<p>
<ul>
<li>Smoothed data - Curve with only the shortest term variations removed.
</li>

<p>
<li>Trend - Upward growth in the data with the seasonal cycle removed.
</li>

<p>
<li>Detrended seasonal cycle - Annual oscillation with trend removed.
</li>

<p>
<li>Seasonal amplitude - Magnitude of the peak to trough of the detrended 
			 seasonal cycle.
</li>

<p>
<li>Growth rate - Rate of increase (first derivative) of the trend.
</li>

</ul>


<p>
   Each of the parameters can be determined from the results of the function
fit and the filtering of the residuals.  The <b>smoothed</b> curve is obtained by
combining the results of the function and the results of the filter using the
short term cutoff value.  The variance of a point on this curve is given by
combining the variances of the function and the filter


<p>
<b>Equation 4: Error estimate of the smoothed data.</b>

<p>
The trend curve is obtained by combining only the polynomial part of the 
function with the results of the filter using the long term cutoff value.  
The variance of the trend is obtained by combining the variance of the function
with the variance of the filter using the long term cutoff value:

<p>
The detrended seasonal cycle is obtained by subtracting the trend curve from
the smooth curve.  The variance of this curve is obtained by combining the
appropriate variances


<p>

<p>
The seasonal amplitude for each year is determined by finding the maximum
value of the detrended cycle minus the minimum value of the detrended cycle. 
The variance of the amplitude is then

<p>
The growth rate is determined by taking the derivative of the trend
curve.  Because the trend is made up of discrete points rather than in a
functional form, a numerical method for calculating the derivative is needed. 
In practice, an interpolating cubic spline curve is computed which passes
through each trend point, with the derivative of the spline at each trend
point also computed.  The derivative is approximately equivalent to taking the
difference of two points one year apart and plotting this difference midway
between the two points.  Thus the variance of the growth rate is given by

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>


<p>
   There are a few things to be aware of when using this curve fitting method.
 For less than 3 years of data it is best to use a linear term for the
polynomial part of the function.  Because the function fit is a least-squares
fit, it is sensitive to outliers.  The FFT filter can produce end effects if
the residuals from the function depart significantly from 0 at the ends of the
record.  This is the reason why the residuals are corrected by a linear fit to
the ends of the data before the FFT is performed.  This especially affects the 
growth rate at the ends of the record.  To get an idea of the uncertainty in the
growth rate, try different values for the number of polynomial terms and observe
the differences.


<p>
   The advantages of this method are that the harmonic coefficients are
valuable as a definition of the annual cycle and can be compared to harmonics
generated by carbon cycle models.  The harmonic function is good for handling
relatively large gaps in the data.  The curve also captures the point of
deepest drawdown in the summer of the northern hemisphere sites without
introducing spurious variability in other parts of the record.  The
combination of harmonics and filtered residuals allows the curve to follow
changes in the shape of the seasonal cycle and interannual variations in the
long term trend.  This method works equally well with either high frequency
in-situ data or relatively low frequency flask sampling data.  Only correct
values for the sampling interval and the filter cutoff are required for either
data set.
