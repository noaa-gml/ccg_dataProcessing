<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>ccgcrv</I>

applies the standard ccg curve fitting routines to a time series data
set.  This curve fit consists of a function fit to the data where the
function is a combination of a polynomial and annual harmonics.  The 
residuals from this fit are then smoothed using a low pass filter.
<P>

If 
<I>file</I>

is not specified, input is from stdin.  The input data must consist of two
columns of numbers. The first column is a decimal year value, and the
second column is the corresponding value.  Columns are separated by white
space.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The following options are used for determining how the curve fits are
made to the data.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-npoly  num</B>

<DD>
Specify the number of polynomial terms to use.  Default is 3.  
<I>num</I>

must be in the range 0 to 10.
<P>
<DT><B>-nharm  num</B>

<DD>
Specify the number of annual harmonic terms to use.  Default is 4.
<I>num</I>

must be in the range 0 to 10.
<P>
<DT><B>-interv  value</B>

<DD>
Specify the average sampling interval between data points.  This is a
floating point number, and units are in days.  If not specified, 
<I>ccgcrv</I>

will calculate it based on the spacing in the input data.
<P>
<DT><B>-short  num</B>

<DD>
Specify the short term cutoff value for the low pass filter.  The short
term value is usually used for applying light smoothing to the data.  Units
for 
<I>num</I>

are in days.  The default value is 50.
<P>
<DT><B>-long  num</B>

<DD>
Specify the long term cutoff value for the low pass filter.  The long
term value is usually used for removing any remaining annual cycles still
present in the residuals after the function fit.  Units for 
<I>num</I>

are in days.  The default value is 667.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-timez  decdate</B>

<DD>
Specify the date at which the coefficients of the function fit will intersect
the y axis, that is, when x = 0.  This should be a decimal year value.
The default value is January 1st for the year of the first data point.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The following options determine the date category of the output.  There
are three categories: sample dates, equally spaced dates, and user defined dates.  
Only one of equally spaced dates or user defined dates should be specified. If
both are, then equally spaced dates are used.  The output for sample date results
can be saved to a file using the 
<B>-s file</B>

option.
The output for the equally spaced or user defined date results can be save to a
file using the
<B>-f file</B>

option.  At least one of the next three options must be specified.  If not, then
<B>-sample</B>

is assumed.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-sample</B>

<DD>
Output data will be printed at the dates corresponding to the input sample data.
The output options (see below)
<B>-orig, -res, -detrend, and -ressm </B>

are available only for this option.
<P>
<DT><B>-equal</B>

<DD>
Output data will be printed at equal time intervals.  The interval is 
specified by 
<B>-interv.  </B>

The times for the output data will not necessarily correspond to the input
data times when using this option.  The starting date is the date of the
first sample.  This can be changed using the 
<B>-date</B>

option (see below).
<P>
<DT><B>-user file</B>

<DD>
Output data will be printed based on dates contained in 'file'. 
The dates should be in decimal year format, and be the
first column in the file.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The next options are used for redirecting output to a file instead of to stdout.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-s file</B>

<DD>
Write sample date defined output data to 'file' instead of stdout.  
This does not affect the
<B>-coef</B>

and 
<B>-stats</B>

options.  
They continue to go to stdout only.
<P>
<DT><B>-f file</B>

<DD>
Write equally spaced or user defined output data to 'file' instead of stdout.  
This does not affect the
<B>-coef</B>

and 
<B>-stats</B>

options.  
They continue to go to stdout only.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The following options determine the dates and date formats for the output results.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-cal</B>

<DD>
Dates and times for output data will be printed using calendar style 
representation.  Default is for decimal year values.  Output consists of
three columns of numbers representing the year, month and day of the data
point.
<P>
<DT><B>-date  yy:mm:dd</B>

<DD>
Specify the starting date of output data.  Normally 
<I>ccgcrv</I>

will print out data for the same period as the input data.  This option 
allows the user to explicitly set the starting date.  When used in conjunction
with
<B>-interv</B>

, equally spaced data at known times can be output.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Different parts of the result curves can be printed to standard output by 
specifying one or more of the following options.  Output consists of columns of numbers 
separated by white space.  The first column is the decimal date 
(or calendar date if
<B>-cal</B>

is specified) in .6f format.  Any remaining columns correspond to any of
the following options that are specified.  Each column has an %8.3f format.
The order of the columns from left to right, regardless of the order of the 
specfied options, is

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>
The most common case is to get all results written to two files, one
with results based on sample dates, one with results based on equally
spaced or user defined dates.  The following example computes curves for
the data in
<B>testfile</B>

and creates the two files 
<B>file1</B>

and
<B>file2. file1</B>

contains results based on sample dates (4 columns of result data), and
<B>file2</B>

contains results based on equally spaced dates (9 columns of result data).
