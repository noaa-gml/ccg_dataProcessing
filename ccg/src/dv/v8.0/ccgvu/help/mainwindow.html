The ccgvu user interface is divided up into several areas.  These are:

<ul>
<li><a href="menus.html">The Menu Bar</a>
<dd>The Menu Bar provides access to all of ccgvu's functions and options.
</li>

<li><a href="toolbars.html">Tool Bars</a>
<dd>The Tool Bars provide shortcuts to commonly used functions, with similar
functions grouped together.
</li>

<li><a href="mainwindow.html#graph">The Graph Area</a>
<dd>
The main graph area is divided into several different tabs, each displaying
a separate graph with different parts from the results of the curve fit.

<h2>CCGVU Graphs</h2>
The different graph tabs in the main window are:
<dl>


<p>
<dt>
	<b>Data</b> 
		<dd>
		The Data graph displays the following data curves:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Original Data - The original data set

		<li>
		Function - The function fit to the data.

		<li>
		Polynomial - The polynomial part of the function.

		<li>
		Smoothed Curve - The best fit curve, that is, the function plus
				short term filtering of the residuals.

		<li>
		Trend Curve - The deseasonalized data, that is, the polynomial
				part of the function plus long term filtering of the
				residuals.
		</ul>



<p>
<dt>
	<b>Seasonal Cycle</b>
		<dd>
		The Seasonal Cycle graph displays the following data curves:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Detrended Data - The original data minus the long term trend line.

		<li>
		Smoothed Seasonal Cycle - 
				The short term filter results plus the harmonics
				part of the function.

		<li>
		Seasonal Cycle Harmonics - 
				The harmonics part of the function.  This is
				the average seasonal cycle.
		</ul>


<p>
<dt>
	<b>Residuals</b>
		<dd>
		The Residuals graph displays the following data curves:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Residuals from Function - 
				The difference between the original data and
				the function fit.

		<li>
		Smoothed residuals - 
				The short term filter results of the function
				residuals.

		<li>
		Trend of residuals - 
				The long term filter results of the function
				residuals.

		<li>
		Residuals from Smoothed Curve - 
				The difference between the original data and 
				the final, best fit smoothed curve.
		</ul>


<p>
<dt>
	<b>Growth Rate</b>
		<dd>
		The Growth Rate graph displays the derivative of the long term 
		trend.

<p>
<dt>
	<b>Amplitude</b>
		<dd>
		The Amplitude graph displays the peak to peak amplitudes
		for each yearly cycle.  The amplitude is calculated by computing
		first the difference between the maximum value of the smooth best fit 
		curve minus the value of the trend.  Then the difference between the
		minimum value of the smooth curve and the trend is calculated.  The
		sum of these two differences is the peak to peak amplitude.

<p>
<dt>
	<b>Filter Response</b>
		<dd>
		This graph plots the response of the filter function using the
		short term cutoff value and the long term cutoff value.  It displays 
		the following data curves:

		<ul>
		<li>
		Short Term Filter - The response function using the short
		term cutoff value.

		<li>
		Long Term Filter - The response function using the long
		term cutoff value.
		</ul>
