<b>The File Menu</b>

<p>
The File menu provides commands that let you work with files in a variety 
of ways.  You can open existing data files from the CO2, CH4, CO, H2 data
base, or import any type of data from a file containing dates and
concentrations.  Various data sets, calculated from the results of the 
curve fits, can be exported to a text file for further manipulation or
viewing.  The current graph can be sent to a hard copy device, or to a file.
