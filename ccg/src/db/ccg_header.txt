************ USE OF NOAA GMD DATA ****************
 
These data are made freely available to the public and the
scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
The availability of these data does not constitute publication
of the data.  We rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to
assure that GMD receives fair credit for our work.  If the data
are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,
GMD should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.
If the GMD data are essential to the work, or if an important
result or conclusion depends on the GMD data, co-authorship may
be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
the work.  Manuscripts using the GMD data should be sent to GMD
for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
represented.

 **************** RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT ****************
 
Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
own data available to the general public and to the scientific
community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
of the GMD data, namely well documented model code, transport
fields, and additional information necessary for other
scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
Model availability includes collaborative support for new
users of the models.
