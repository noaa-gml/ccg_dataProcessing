.. module::conda 
      :synopsis: Common python installation

This is a common installation of python 3 that can be used on centos 7/8 servers and linux workstations with access to /ccg nfs share.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

.. function:: ~/.bash_profile

   Add this to the end of your ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc if you use that)
 
   .. code-block:: bash

      if [ -f /ccg/python/.miniconda_bashrc ]; then
         source /ccg/python/.miniconda_bashrc
      fi 

   You will need to log out and back in or source above for it to take effect.

Using ccglib python packages
----------------------------

To transparently use the ccglib python packages, users must set the PYTHONPATH environment variable correctly.

Running the above bash script which will set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include ``/ccg/python/ccglib`` when searching for modules.  A user can also set the PYTHONPATH variable with 

   .. code-block:: bash

      export PYTHONPATH=/ccg/python/ccglib

If PYTHONPATH is set, then packages can be imported like

   .. code-block:: python

      import ccg_db_conn

where the ``ccg_db_conn`` module resides in the directory ``/ccg/python/ccglib``.
