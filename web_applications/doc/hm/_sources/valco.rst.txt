valco
========================

        These actions are for use with Valco stream selection valves using the Universal Actuator.

.. _valco_turn_valve:

TurnValve or TurnUniversalActuator
----------------------------------

        Turn a Valco valve with Universal Acutator.  Either multiposition or two
        position valve.

        Option string syntax is:

          ``time    TurnValve      valve_name    position  (direction)``

        Example:

          ``0    TurnValve    SampleSelect    2     (up or down)``

        The direction is an optional argument for multiposition valves, and can be:

                * up = CW (clockwise)
                * down = CC (counter clockwise)
                * default if no direction given is shortest

        or for two position valves:

          ``0    TurnUniversalAcuator    CH4inject    Load``

        Valve name can be either the device name set in the configuration file,
        or a 'virtual' name defined in the configuration file with an associated device
        For example

        .. code-block:: bash

            #device definition (can have one or many valves on same serial port)
            device  ValcoValves      serial /dev/ttyS1 0 9600

            # Information on multi-position valves
            # type = multiposition
            #name           device       type           id  max_positions
            SampleSelect    ValcoValves  multiposition  0   16

            #Use '*' for id if valve is not set with an id number

            # Information of 2-position valves
            # type = two_position
            # name          device    type  id  load_position  Inject_position
            CH4inject    ValcoValves  two_position  1  A  B

        Then use either

            ``0 TurnValve ValcoValves 4``

            or

            ``0 TurnValve SampleSelect 4``

        The 'virtual' name method is required if multiple valves are connected to the same
        interface, using different ID numbers for each valve.

        .. note::
           The 'TurnUniversalActuator' name was used in previous versions of hm.  The name
           'TurnValve' should be used from now on.

.. _valco_current_position:

ValcoCurrentPosition
--------------------

        Get the curent position from a valco universal actuator.

        Action line syntax is:

                ``time    ValcoCurrentPosition     valve_name    none``

        Example:

               ``0 ValcoCurrentPosition SystemSelect None``

        Result:
                The current position number is printed to stdout.

.. _valco_find_stops:

ValcoFindStops
--------------

        Find stops on Valco two position valve.

        Action line syntax:

                ``time    ValcoFindStops          valve_name    none``

        Example:

                ``0 ValcoFindStops CH4inject none``

        Result:
                The command 'LRN' for finding the stops on the valve is sent to the valve.

        .. warning::
           This action is for two position valves only.  If used on a multiposition valve, and
           error message is written to the log file.
