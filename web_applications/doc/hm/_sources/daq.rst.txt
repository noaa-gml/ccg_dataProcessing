ReadNumber
----------
        Read a single floating point value back from a device

        Action line syntax:

                ``0 ReadData device devid``

        Read a value from the daq.  The 'devid' option is the rs-485 id and channel combined into one 3 character string,
        'AAN' where AA is the hex id, and N is the channel number, e.g. '011' is device id 01 channel 1.
        Data value is stored in hm's internal *last_data* variable.  Use routines such as :ref:`log_data` to retreive the data.
